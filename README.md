## Conclusion: 
Saturday has the maximum and mode of bicycle sessions within the span of 12
months. For marketing purposes, we can promote and incentivize users to use our
service on Saturdays with sending notifications on their phone, post in social media.
Since, classic bikes for both groups outnumbered docked and electric bikes even if
casual members use docked bikes more than annual members, we can offer deals
on classic bikes and then convert them to be a annual member. For instance, we
can give casual members free first 5 sessions to ride our classic bikes if you are an
annual member. So, sign up today! We know the casual members we can target
with our marketing campaigns and efforts by using the top locations of
where riders use our services the most.

Offer deals on classic bikes and then convert them to be an annual member which
is a good incentive. Send notifications on their phone, post in social media on
Saturdays. Target population for our marketing campaign is the casual members in
the top 10 locations of where riders use our service the most.
